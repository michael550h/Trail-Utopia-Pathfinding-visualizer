# Trail-Utopia
Optimal path between 'n' nodes containing obstacels

 
 It's a pathfinding visulizer that contains following alogrithms such as :
 1. Dijkstra Algorithm(weighted)
 2. A*(weighted)
 3. Greedy Best First search(weighted)
 4. Swarm Optimization(weighted)
 5. Breadth First Search(un-weighted)
 6. Dept First Search(un-weighted)
